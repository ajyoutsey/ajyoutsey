### 🖐 Hello there, I’m Alex Youtsey!

#### 👦🏻 A little about me...

I'm a senior studying Computer Science and Economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

This fall I'm an SDE intern at Amazon Pharmacy working on a project to deduplicate errors and reduce my team's on-call burden. 
I've previously interned at b.well Connected Health as a Data Engineering Intern.

Outside of programming, I'm an avid reader 📚, a slowly improving golfer 🏌️‍♂️, and a supporter of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club ⚽️.
