### 🖐 Hello there, I’m Alex Youtsey!

#### 👦🏻 A little about me...

I graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2023 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Economics.

In Fall 2022, I was an SDE intern at Amazon Pharmacy working on a project to deduplicate errors and reduce my team's on-call burden. 
I've previously interned at b.well Connected Health as a Data Engineering Intern.

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading 📚, playing golf 🏌️‍♂️, and watching Tottenham Hotspur ⚽️.
